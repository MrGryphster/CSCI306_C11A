Here are three best practices to consider when using exceptions:
1. Use checked exceptions (i.e. try-catch blocks) for recoverable errors in
the program flow, and unchecked exceptions for errors that disable or halt the
program entirely. 
2. Don't ever "swallow" or ignore an exception - it should always be handled
properly, or passed on to where it can be handled. 
3. Never catch all instances of Throwable. For example, Errors are a subclass
of Throwable which can cause significant errors and unpredictable behavior if
you try to handle them, assuming that they even can be handled at all. Also,
many Errors (and other subclasses of Throwable) are not recoverable at all, so
trying to handle them will just cause further crashes.
